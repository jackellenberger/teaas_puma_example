      %h1 Total (or bloody) Emojis as a Service! (TEaaS)

      %p Add a touch of blood to your emoji.
      %img(src="blood.gif")

      %p The source image is very low resolution, so results may vary. Only works best on square or square-ish images.

      %h2 LET THE FORM BEGIN!
      %form(method="POST" action="/bloodify" enctype="multipart/form-data")
        %p Note: File should not be animated (static GIFs are supported)
