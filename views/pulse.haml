      %p Want to generate your own pulsing emoji? Here's the place! Pulsing images look something like this:
      %img(src="pulse.gif")

      %h2 LET THE FORM BEGIN!
      %form(method="POST" action="/pulse" enctype="multipart/form-data")
        %p Note: File should not be animated (static GIFs are supported)
