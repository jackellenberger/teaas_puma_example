[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

An example Heroku app that demonstrates the functionality of [Teaas](https://github.com/wjr1985/teaas). This will run just fine on the Heroku free tier. I use this currently without issue, although it hasn't gone under a ton of heavy load before.

Uses Bootstrap and HAML templates, and is overall janky and hacky, but it works!
